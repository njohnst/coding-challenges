* Starting from V2, convert to client-server architecture
* 4 hour time limit
3PM start, pause at 5:20 (+2h 20m)
restart at 710PM -> 8:25PM (+1h 15m = 3h 35m)
restart at 1220AM -> 1245AM (+25m = 4h)
out of time, committing

* new 2hr extension
* continuing on from 1245 -> 235AM (+1h 50m)

finished, working, playable state but buggy and insecure, good enough for the time constraint
